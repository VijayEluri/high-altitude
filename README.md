# High Altitude Balloon
This is code for an Arduino microcontroller built to live on a weather balloon sent to over 100k feet.

It uses the NewSoftSerial library from Mikal Hart, available [from his website](http://arduiniana.org/libraries/NewSoftSerial/).

Most of the hardware is available from SparkFun Electronics, including:

* [Arduino Pro Mini](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9218)
* [USB Weather Board](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8311)
* [Tilt Compensated Digital Compass](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8656)

Much more to come...
